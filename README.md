## Dependencies

You need python 2.7 to run this project, as well as the pip tool to install the dependencies (a python virtual environment is reconmmended). To install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Deployment

This deploys as a regular python wsgi application. Edit the config.py, or create your own local_config.py with the values you want to overwrite, to provide your odk instance configuration, and you are good to go. For testing, you can just run the app.py file with python and point your browser to localhost:5000

    python app.py
